# PPO Lane Following Controller

This project implements a reinforcement learning-based controller using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for a simplified lane-following environment.

### Why it matters
- Demonstrates autonomous control logic
- Custom gym-style environment simulating lane deviation
- Trained agent minimizes lateral error, similar to comma.aiâ€™s Controls Challenge

### Tools
- Python, Stable-Baselines3, Gymnasium
